# shnrble-api

<!-- badges: start -->

This is a testing and dev repo that I'm using to play with REST APIs in R via the {plumber} library. Nothing in here should be taken very seriously, for this, like Camelot, is a silly place.  

![Camelot Tis a Silly Place](img/camelot-tis-silly.jpg)  

## Current Stuff in Here:  
- **animal-sound**: A plumber API which returns the sounds that a dog makes in a few different languages. This also has an endpoint for counting and conversion to numbers, which ostensibly counts the number of cats and dogs provided.
