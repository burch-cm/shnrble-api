## What Is This?  

This is a testing and dev repo that Iâ€™m using to play with REST APIs in
R via the {plumber} library. Nothing in here should be taken very
seriously, for this, like Camelot, is a silly place.

## About the Name  
My family had an elderly Lhasa-Apso that lived to be about 427 years old, give or take. When she felt grumpy, which was constantly, she would make a kind of **shnrble** sound. Since the first test API here returns dog sounds from other languages, it only seemed appropriate to name the repo after Mazie's particular onomatopeia.  

## Current Stuff in Here:

  - **bark**: A plumber API which returns the sounds that a dog
    makes in a few different languages. This also has an endpoint for
    counting and conversion to numbers, which ostensibly counts the
    number of cats and dogs provided.

## Stuff to Add:
### A note to my future self  
- deploy a plumber API inside a Docker container
- deploy an API at OpenCPU - [burch-cm@OpenCPU](https://burch-cm.ocpu.io/bark)
